# FastLloyd: Federated, Accurate, Secure, and Tunable k-Means Clustering with Differential Privacy

FastLloyd addresses the challenge of performing $k$-means clustering in a horizontally federated setting while preserving data privacy. Existing methods suffer from either high computational overhead or significantly degrade clustering utility. FastLloyd overcomes these limitations through a novel federated protocol that enhances both the differential privacy mechanism and the secure computation components. 

A new DP clustering algorithm is introduced, which incorporates a radius constraint on clusters and uses relative updates to improve utility. This algorithm is integrated into a federated setting using a lightweight, secure aggregation protocol (Masked Secure Aggregation - MSA) that leverages the computational DP model. This allows intermediate differentially private updates to be published, significantly reducing the overhead of secure computation by performing expensive operations like assignments and divisions locally. 

FastLloyd significantly outperforms previous work; It achieves up to a five-orders-of-magnitude speed-up in runtime compared to state-of-the-art secure federated $k$-means approaches, while also reducing communication by up to seven orders of magnitude. Furthermore, FastLloyd not only matches the utility of central DP models but improves upon state-of-the-art DP $k$-means algorithms, especially in higher dimensions and for a larger number of clusters, demonstrating up to an 88% reduction in clustering error.

## Overview

This repository implements the FastLloyd protocol described in the paper "FastLloyd: Federated, Accurate, Secure, and
Tunable k-Means Clustering with Differential Privacy". FastLloyd addresses the challenging problem of collaborative
clustering across multiple data owners without compromising privacy, through:

1. A novel differentially private k-means algorithm with radius constraints
2. A lightweight secure aggregation protocol for federated settings

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Open MPI (for multiparty communication)
- Required Python packages listed in `env.yml`

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/D-Diaa/FastLloyd.git
cd FastLloyd
```

2. Create and activate the conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate fastlloyd
```

3. Download and prepare datasets:

```bash
python scripts/download_data.py
```

This creates the `data/` directory and populates it with all required datasets. The script fetches:

| Source | Datasets |
|--------|----------|
| scikit-learn | `iris`, `wine`, `breast`, `house`, `mnist` |
| UCI ML Repository | `adult`, `yeast` |
| Synthetic (generated) | `s1`, `lsun`, `birch2`, `timesynth_*` |

> **Note:** The `s1`, `lsun`, and `birch2` datasets are synthetic approximations of the
> original SIPU clustering benchmarks. The `mnist` dataset uses sklearn's 8x8 digits
> (1797 samples) rather than the full 28x28 MNIST. Results may differ from the original paper.

For synthetic scale/ablation datasets, you can additionally run the R generator:

```bash
Rscript scripts/generator.R
```
