class Server:
    """Server implementation for privacy-preserving federated clustering.
    
    This class implements the server-side operations in a federated clustering system,
    with particular focus on privacy preservation through differential privacy mechanisms.
    The server aggregates masked statistics from clients and can apply differential
    privacy noise before sharing results back.
    
    The server supports two differential privacy mechanisms:
    1. Laplace mechanism: Provides ε-differential privacy
    2. Gaussian mechanism: Provides (ε,δ)-differential privacy
    
    The privacy budget (ε) is split between count queries and sum queries based on
    the configuration parameters.

        count_mech: Differential privacy mechanism for count queries
        sum_mech: Differential privacy mechanism for sum queries
