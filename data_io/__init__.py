"""
Data input/output and processing utilities for distributed computing applications.

This package provides tools for:
- Loading and preprocessing numerical data
- Splitting data among multiple clients for distributed processing
- Converting between floating-point and fixed-point representations
- Normalizing data values

The package is designed to support distributed computing scenarios where data
needs to be processed and shared among multiple clients, with particular
support for fixed-point arithmetic operations.
